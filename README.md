# LooksSame

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gemini-testing/looks-same.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gemini-testing/looks-same)

Pure node.js library for comparing PNG-images, taking into account human color perception.
It is created specially for the needs of visual regression testing for [`gemini`](http://github.com/gemini-testing/gemini)
utility, but can be used for other purposes.

## Comparing images

```javascript
var looksSame = require('looks-same');

looksSame('image1.png', 'image2.png', function(error, equal) {
    //equal will be true, if images looks the same
});
```

Parameters can be paths to files or buffer with compressed `png` image.

By default, it will detect only noticeable differences. If you wish to detect any difference,
use `strict` options:

```javascript
looksSame('image1.png', 'image2.png', {strict: true}, function(error, equal) {
    ...
});
```

You can also adjust the [Î”E](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference) value that will be treated as error
in non-strict mode:

```javascript
looksSame('image1.png', 'image2.png', {tolerance: 5}, function(error, equal) {
    ...
});
```

Default `tolerance` in non-strict mode is 2.3 which is enough for the most cases.
Setting `tolerance` to 0 will produce the same result as `strict: true`, but strict mode
is faster.
Attempt to set `tolerance` in strict mode will produce an error.

For visual regression tasks it may be useful to ignore text caret in text input elements.
You can do it with `ignoreCaret` option.

```javascript
looksSame('image1.png', 'image2.png', {ignoreCaret: true}, function(error, equal) {
    ...
});
```

Both `strict` and `ignoreCaret` can be set independently of one another.

## Building diff image

```javascript
looksSame.createDiff({
    reference: '/path/to/reference/image.png',
    current: '/path/to/reference/image.png',
    diff: '/path/to/save/diff/to.png',
    highlightColor: '#ff00ff', //color to highlight the differences
    strict: false,//strict comparsion
    tolerance: 2.5
}, function(error) {
});
```

## Building diff image as a Buffer

If you don't want the diff image to be written on disk, then you can pass {save: false} to the createDiff method. The callback will then receive a Buffer containing the diff as the 2nd argument. Default is to save the image on disk.

```javascript
looksSame.createDiff({
    //exactly same options as above
    save: false
}, function(error, buffer) {
    ...
});
```
